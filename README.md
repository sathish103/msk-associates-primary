# MSK & Associates Chartered Accountants Website

This workspace contains a polished static website for **MSK & Associates Chartered Accountants**. It has been engineered to look and behave like a real‑world professional firm site, with full responsiveness on desktop and mobile. Features include:

- Sticky header with anchor navigation and scroll‑spy highlighting
- Hero banner slideshow with rotating captions
- Services overview, team bios, background information and contact section
- Embedded Google Map, social media links and contact details
- Custom chat widget offering quick answers and prompting users to reach out
- Smooth scroll between page sections and a top contact bar

The codebase is intentionally simple HTML/CSS/JS so you can host it on any static server or GitHub Pages.
